    * Bumped dependencies to latest version and updated code to match.
    * Refactored project structure to make source file hierarchy more sensible.
    * Cleaned up (parts of) code for readability purposes.
    * Improved source variable naming to reflect actual purpose.
    * Reduced repetition: the different Within, Between, and Closure classes
      and functions have been generalized to fit all modi.
    * Changed unsecure Schema.org namespace to secure variant.
    * Fixed bug in age check that excluded the maximum value.
    * Fixed bug with incorrect metadata in closure function output of Within
      data.
    * Added feature to provide custom data model for input graphs.
    * Added feature to provide custom base namespace for reconstructed
      individuals.
    * Added feature to provide custom validation rule set for processess.
    * Changed intermediate CSV result structure to ensure consistency between
      different modi.
    * Change generation of reconstructed person identifiers to be based on
      person IDs, ensuring consistency between runs. URIs starting with 'I-'
      pertain between runs; those starting with 'U-' can change.
    * Added header to links-individuals file.
    * Added feature to allow appending new data to existing data store.
    * Change input parameter names to better convey their purpose.
    * Added feature to provide basic query functionality.
    * Added feature to execute all functions after one another if none is
      specified.
    * Changed progress bar to activity indicator.
    * Cleaned up messages to standard output.
    * Added native support for text-encoded RDF format (e.g. N-Triples and
      N-Quads). This removes the need to first convert the input data to
      HDT format. Instead, an on-disk triple store is created and queried.
    * Added support for (remote) SPARQL endpoint as input.
    * Fixed bug in timeline consistency check of parents that checked age
      instead of age difference.
    * Changes output format of closure funtion to conform to PiCo
      PersonReconstructed objects.
    * Added CSV-to-RDF conversion scripts for CIV and PiCo data models.
    * Removed the need for (event and person) identifiers in favour of IRIs.
    * Removed duplicated entries from output of closure function that were
      caused by aggregating all attributes of linked individuals.
    * Added feature 'within-M-M' that links between brides/grooms between
      remarriages and divorces.
    * Updated and extended README.
    * Many minor changes.
