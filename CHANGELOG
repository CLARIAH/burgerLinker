    * Refactored project structure to make source file hierarchy more sensible.
    * Cleaned up (parts of) code for readability purposes.

    * Changed intermediate CSV result structure to ensure consistency between
      different modi.
    * Change generation of reconstructed person identifiers to be based on
      person IDs, ensuring consistency between runs.
    * Moved from Maven to Ant build tool (incl Ivy) to simplify compiling.
